// Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. 
// Students of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request.
// Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of club.
// Write C++ program to maintain club memberâ€˜s information using singly linked list.
// Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to: 
// a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary
// b) Compute total number of members of club 
// c) Display members 
// d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions, Concatenate two lists
